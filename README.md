# ðŸ“Š Telco Customer Churn Analysis

Welcome to the **Telco Customer Churn Analysis** project! This project aims to explore customer behavior and predict churn using statistical and machine learning techniques in R.

---

##  Project Overview

Churn prediction is vital for telecom companies aiming to retain customers and reduce revenue loss. In this project, we:

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- Preprocess and clean the dataset 
- Build and evaluate models:
  - Logistic Regression 
  - Neural Networks 

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is from the [IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.
